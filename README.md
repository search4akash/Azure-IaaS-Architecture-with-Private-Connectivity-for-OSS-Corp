# Cross-Region VNet Peering in Azure: A Step-by-Step Guide 
-----  
## "Introduction"

In this project, I tried to explore how to set up cross-region V-Net peering in Microsoft Azure. 
VNet peering allows usres to connect virtual networks across different Azure regions securely. Weâ€™ll cover the necessary steps and provide an architectural diagram to illustrate the setup.
Here is the Architectural Diagram:

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
**Azure Subscription**: Youâ€™ll need an active Azure subscription.
**Two VNets**: Create two virtual networks (VNets) in different Azure regions. These VNets will be peered.
**Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: If you want to control traffic between VNets, configure NSGs accordingly.
_Action Group_: This is optional either you can ignore it or set this to get Azure App/ E-mail notificatons

**Step 1**: Create VNets
            Log in to the Azure Portal.
            Navigate to Virtual networks and create two VNets (one in each region).
            Note down the VNet names and their respective address spaces.

**Step 2**: Configure Peering
            In the Azure portal, go to the settings of the first VNet.
            Under Settings, select Peerings.
            Click Add to create a new peering.
            Specify the second VNetâ€™s details (name, resource group, etc.).
            Repeat the process for the second VNet, peering it with the first one.
           
**Step 3**: Verify Connectivity
            In each VNet, create a test VM.
            Ping the VMs across VNets to verify connectivity.

### *Conclusion*
Cross-region VNet peering enables seamless communication between VNets across different Azure regions. Remember to follow best practices for security and governance.
